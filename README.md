# Language Learning Platform

A modern, responsive language learning website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, inspired by the LEARNme Education design.

## Features

- Homepage with hero section
- Navigation bar and footer
- Course cards for different languages
- Clean, modern UI

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Customization

Replace placeholder content and images with your own language learning materials.
